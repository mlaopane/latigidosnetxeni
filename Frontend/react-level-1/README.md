### Installation

```shell
yarn install
```

### Run the application

```shell
yarn start
```

### Structure

The root `App` component renders the `Checkboxes`, including the `select/unselect all` checkbox and the items checkboxes.

You can add or remove items checkboxes according to your needs.

The `AppContextProvider` component allows all children to access shared state and actions.

The logic of the components is externalized in custom React hooks.
